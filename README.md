# offline-forum

>Example app built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for integration and snapshot testing. The app is a forum with posts and comments that uses `localStorage`. It also has a bot that responds with delay. **CSS-framework is [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)**

The project is already set up with all packages to test react components: [**`enzyme`**](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/), `enzyme-adapter-react-16`, `react-test-renderer` and `enzyme-to-json` for snapshot testing. You can read more about setting it up here: [**Running test @ create-react-app**](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)
